Honestly? I feel pretty calm. It’s bright out there, and I don’t feel the usual tension in my chest yet.

Okay… did it just get darker? I hear rain. Is that part of the simulation?
Right… I know that. But part of me still thinks, 'what if this means something worse is coming?'

The rain’s really coming down now... I know it’s fake, but it’s starting to feel real. It’s reminding me of that flight I had where we got stuck circling for an hour.
-
Yeah, I get that logically… but I can already feel my shoulders tensing up, and I’m bracing—like waiting for something worse.
<BREATHE>
It’s hard, but I’m still here. That’s something, right?
-
Okay.
-
Oh God… the lightning! This is exactly what I dread. What if something goes wrong? I can’t handle this!
-
It feels so real though. I’m starting to shake.

<SCREAM>
I’m terrified... my heart’s racing, but I’m trying not to panic. It feels so real—I don’t know if I can do this

I’m still shaking… I can’t shake this feeling. The rain and lightning are still out there, and it feels like the danger hasn’t passed.

Yeah, it’s calmer now… but honestly, I feel kind of bitter. Like, why do I have to put myself through this? It’s exhausting.

The plane looks normal again… but I can’t shake this worry. It feels like it’s still lingering.
