Um... about a 4. Maybe 5.
It's actually pretty calm. People talking softly.
Yeah, I can handle this.
I guess it's not as scary as I thought it would be.
Right now, anyway.
The sky... it's getting cloudy.
I don't like it. Something's not right.
Like when you know something bad is coming.
I'm getting more nervous.
I wish it would just stay sunny.
-
There's lightning now. I'm getting worried.
Like really worried. This could be dangerous.
Tight. Everything feels tight.
I know, but it's hard to remember.
I want this part to be over.
-
Big time. I'm really tense now.
My whole body. Like I'm bracing for something.
But I hate feeling this way.
It keeps getting worse.
-
I'm scared. Really scared now.
-
I want it to stop.
Why does it have to feel so awful?
Well, it's working.
Barely.
-
9! Maybe 10! This is really bad!
I feel like we're going to crash.
It feels real.
I can't handle much more of this.
I don't feel like I am.
Everyone's screaming! This is it!
I can barely breathe.
We're all going to die.
Yes.
I guess so.
-
Maybe... is it shaking less?
I'm still terrified though.
When will this end?
-
Still high. 8 maybe?
I didn't realize that happened.
Better, I think. Still scared but... better.
The shaking is definitely less.
I'm still tense. Like it could get bad again any second.
I don't trust that it's really over.
Angry, honestly. Like, what was the point of all that suffering?
