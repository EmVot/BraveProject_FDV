Welcome back, Alex. You're seated on the plane, and everything looks peaceful right now. How are you feeling in this moment?
Good.

Yes, you’re noticing it correctly. Light rain has started outside the window. Just like in a real flight, the weather can shift gently. But inside this cabin, nothing’s changed—your space is still stable.
That’s a powerful insight. That ‘what if’ voice is old wiring. But right now, you have new tools. 
Let’s take one breath together—deep in… and out slowly. We’re not rushing forward. You’re still in control.

I hear you. That memory is loud right now. Let’s acknowledge it—your mind is connecting this scene with that past discomfort. But here and now, you’re safe. This is not that flight.
This is a controlled space where you are practicing staying present, even when things feel uncertain.
Let’s work with that feeling, not against it. Shift your awareness to your breath for a moment. Notice the tension in your shoulders without trying to fix it. Just observe.
You’re not in danger—you’re in training. You’re rewiring your response one breath at a time.
You’re doing exactly what this therapy is about—staying with the discomfort, not running from it.
And now, we’re going to take one more step together. It might feel harder, but remember: you're not alone, and nothing here can harm you.

This feels really intense right now, and that’s okay. Your body is responding exactly as it should when faced with perceived danger. Let’s focus on your breath—slow, steady.
You’re in the room with me, and this storm is just a part of the simulation, designed to help you get stronger.
That shaking is your nervous system releasing tension. It’s a sign you’re alive and working through your fear. 
Stay with me. We’re safe here. I’ll guide you through it. You’ve faced this before, and you’ve stayed present. You can do it again.

Alex, I know this feels overwhelming right now, but remember—you’re safe and supported. The masks are part of the simulation to help your brain get used to uncertainty.
Focus on your breath with me—slow and steady—and feel the strength you’ve built to face this moment.

It’s okay to feel distressed, Alex. Your mind is still on high alert, but notice how the plane is steadier now, the lights have stopped blinking. The storm is less intense than before, even if it’s still visible.
Let’s focus on what’s here, what’s real right now. You’re safe in this moment, and I’m right here with you. Breathe.

Good job, go on.

Is it better now?
That’s completely valid, Alex. Facing fear isn’t easy, and it’s normal to feel frustrated or tired after pushing through so much.
This bitterness shows how real this struggle is for you. Remember, every step you take here is rewiring those old fears, even if it doesn’t feel good right now.

That’s okay, Alex. Worry doesn’t vanish overnight—it often lingers after facing tough moments. What matters is that you stayed present and experienced it without avoiding.
We’ll keep working on this together. Take pride in what you’ve accomplished today.
