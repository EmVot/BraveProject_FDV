The simulation is starting now. You're on the airplane. What's your SUDS rating right now, zero to ten?
That's manageable. What are you noticing around you?
Good. Just stay present with whatever comes up.
Your body language looks more relaxed than when we started.
That's important information. You're discovering something new about your capacity.
What's shifting for you now?
And how does that feel?
Tell me more about that "not right" feeling.
Your intuition is picking up on environmental changes. That's your mind trying to predict.
I can see that tension building in your shoulders.
Part of you wants to control the environment. That makes perfect sense.
What's happening for you as the weather changes more?
Worried how?
Your worry is showing up as protection. What does worry feel like in your body?
That tightness is your system preparing. You're still safe here with me.
Of course it is. Your emotional brain is very activated right now.
The waiting and anticipation can be the hardest part.
I notice the seatbelt sign just came on. What's that like for you?
Where do you feel that tension most?
Your body is doing exactly what it's designed to do when sensing potential threat.
I know you do. The discomfort is really intense.
-
That fear is completely understandable. This is exactly what we're here to work with.
-
Your whole system wants to escape this feeling. That's so normal.
Fear is designed to feel awful - that's how it motivates us to get to safety.
You're still here though. Even with intense fear, you're staying present.
-
What's your SUDS rating right now?
You're at peak distress right now. And you're still talking to me.
That catastrophic thought is so strong right now.
Your fear is making it feel absolutely real. That's how powerful our emotional brain is.
But you are handling it. Right now, in this moment, you're handling maximum distress.
-
Your distress is at its absolute peak. What do you notice about your breathing?
Let's breathe together. In for four... out for four...
That thought feels completely true right now, doesn't it?
And yet here you are, still breathing, still present with me.
Even at maximum terror, you're surviving it.
-
Something's shifting slightly. Are you picking up on that?
Your nervous system is detecting that subtle change.
Of course you are. You're still in the thick of it.
You're starting to experience that the peak doesn't last forever.
What's your SUDS rating now?
From a 10 to an 8. Your system is beginning to recognize the shift.
How are you feeling as things continue to calm down?
You're discovering something about how fear changes over time.
That hypervigilance makes complete sense after what you just went through.
Everything's back to normal now. How are you feeling?
That anger makes complete sense. You survived something that felt life-threatening, and now it's like it never happened.
