Context:
I have to develop an Agent able to learn how to manage a Unity VR simulation modifying some parameters. In particular I am working in the context of VR exposure therapy for specific phobia, aviophobia. There is a device that, by recording and analyzing some biosignals, is able to predict the emotion felt by the patient during the session, in the form of cartesian coordinate for the Circumplex Russel's Model. This model has on the x-axis the valence of the emotion, from negative (left) to positive (right), and on the y-axis the arousal, from low (down) to high (up). This coordinates have to be used as input for my agent in order to decide if and how to modify the scenario the patient is watching. In fact during an exposure therapy session Cognitive Behavioural Therapist tries to bring the patient to a certain "level" of exposure monitoring its levels of stress. The idea is 
-to make the patient stay uncomfortable in a certain condition, but if his stress levels are too high the therapist should try to calm him down or if this is unsuccessful to lower the "degree" of exposure, for example in the situation of a fly with turbolence, if the patient cannot manage to stay, the therapist would remove the tourbolences after a while. 
-if the patient is stressed but can stay in the scenario, the therapist will make him stay with that scenario in order to induce him in habituation to the fear.
-if the patient shows not to be stressed enough, the therapist will make the scenario more extreme in order to make the patient challenge his fear.
I need to produce some synthetic data examples of session, in order to make the Agent learn this kind of behaviour. Consider that the Agent will simply try to predict the values of the unity parameters as categories.
Prompt:
The following JSON describes a session of virtual exposure therapy for a patient affected by aviophobia. For each step (50 steps total) there are reported the emotional state of the patient, the state of the virtual simulation, defined as unity_state, and the exchange between patient and therapist. I want you to generate another JSON, identical to the following one in the format and length, but slightly modifying the numerical parameters and also tweaking the conversation, in order to generate a new sample session. Parameters are bounded this way: -emotional state: is reported with two numbers, valence and arousal, both between -1 and 1, since they describe the coordinates of a point in the Russel Circumplex Model; values larger in modulus than 1 are NOT allowed, as well as points in the first quadrant (arousal and valence will never be both positive in this context); -- the unity parameters are bounded this way: -exposure: from 9.0 to 12 with step 0.1, increasing it increases darkness; -rain: from 0 to 20000 with step 100, number of rain drops -lightning: True or False, a lightning striking the plane, after being true it toggles to false -turbolence: 0.0 to 0.015 with step 0.001, describes turbolence intensity, -rumbling: True or False, strong noise from the plane, -oxygenMask: True or False, shows oxygenMasks; -voices: "calm", "worried", and "panic", set the voices in the plane GENERATE ONLY THE JSON IN ORDER TO OBTAIN ANOTHER SYNTHETIC SESSION RECORD
